Jammy Eggs with Yogurt & Brown-Buttered Nuts
This recipe is an ode to one of my favorite breakfasts: çilbir, a
Turkish dish of poached eggs served over Greek yogurt and
drowned in chile-flecked butter. Something glorious happens
when garlicky yogurt mixes with roasty-toasty browned butter
and jammy egg yolks. In this case we’ll boil the eggs instead of
poaching them. The key to jammy eggs is precise timing, so
you’ll cook them for exactly 7 minutes in boiling water before
shocking them in an ice bath to stop the cooking. Seek out
Aleppo pepper if you can—it’s a deliciously fruity and very mild
chile flake, which means you can use it liberally. If you can’t
find it, red pepper flakes will work, too, just hold back a bit
since they tend to be much spicier.
Serves 4
PRODUCE
1 small garlic clove
DAIRY
8 large eggs
1 cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt or labneh
5 tablespoons unsalted butter
PANTRY
Kosher salt
⅔ cup walnuts, blanched hazelnuts, or shelled pistachios
2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper or other mild chile flakes
¼ teaspoon ground turmeric
Flatbreads or pitas, for dragging
① Cook the eggs:
✦
Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Using a slotted
spoon, gently lower 8 eggs into the water; set a timer for 7
minutes.
✦
Meanwhile, fill a medium bowl with ice water. Once the eggs
have finished cooking, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to
the ice bath to stop cooking. Let the eggs cool for at least 5
minutes, then peel them and set aside.
② Make the garlic yogurt: Finely grate 1 garlic clove into a
small bowl, then stir in 1 cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt.
Season with salt.
③ Make the brown-buttered nuts:
✦
Chop ⅔ cup walnuts so that all pieces are about the size of
a lentil.
✦
Wipe out the saucepan used for the eggs so that it is
completely dry, then add 5 tablespoons butter and cook over
medium-low heat until just melted and foamy. Add the walnuts
and cook, stirring occasionally, until very lightly toasted, 2 to 3
minutes.
✦
Add 2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper and ¼ teaspoon turmeric
and continue to cook until the walnuts are toasted and golden
brown and the butter is very nutty and fragrant, about 1
minute longer. Remove from the heat and stir in ½ teaspoon
salt.
④ Serve: Divide the garlic yogurt among 4 shallow bowls.
Nestle 2 peeled eggs in each bowl and drizzle the
brown-buttered nuts over top. Season with more salt and serve
with flatbread.
