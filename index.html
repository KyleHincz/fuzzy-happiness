Meanwhile, fill a medium bowl with ice water. Once the eggs have finished cooking, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the ice bath to stop cooking. Let the eggs cool for at least 5 minutes, then peel them and set aside."

Wipe out the saucepan used for the eggs so that it is completely dry, then add 5 tablespoons butter and cook over medium-low heat until just melted and foamy. Add the walnuts and cook, stirring occasionally, until very lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper and ¼ teaspoon turmeric and continue to cook until the walnuts are toasted and golden brown and the butter is very nutty and fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Remove from the heat and stir in ½ teaspoon salt."
